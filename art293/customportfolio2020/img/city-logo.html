        <h1>Copenhagen City Tourism Logo</h1>
        <h3 class="subheader">ART 127–Graphic Symbolism</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="two-thirds column">
                <p>For this project, I was tasked with creating a logo for a city of my choosing. As you can see, I chose Copenhagen. Copenhagen is known for its eco-friendly initiatives and technology, its Tivoli Gardens, Nyhavn Harbor, and much more. It is also the capital city of Denmark. Denmark ranks highest in the world for happiness! This is believed to be linked to danish people's feelings of social equality, individual freedom, and community spirit. Danish design is also well-known to be functional, but warm and inviting.
                </p>
                <p>This logo was abstractly inspired by the Louis Poulsen lamp designed by Poul Henningsen. Danish design has form follow function. Such is the case for these lamps, also called "tivoli lamps" because their presence in the Tivoli Amusement Parks. The forms of this lamp uniquely shapes the light that it emits. I thought the pleasure of a well-crafted light was the perfect place to draw inspiration from because it allows people to partake in hygge.</p>
                <p> English doesn't have a word equivalent to Hygge, but it can be described as taking time away from the daily rush to enjoy the good things in life. Because of the long, cold, and dark winters in Copenhagen, the gentle light emitted from a lamp could be viewed as comforting.</p>
